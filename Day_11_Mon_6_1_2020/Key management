Key management for the users of my contract.

Since my contract is a casino game therefore I have a advice for two kind of users.
These are normal players and high rollers and the difference between the two is. 
The amount of crypto they have and are willing to spend on Roulette.

For normal players I recommend a wallet like MetaMask because it’s easy to install on multiple devices and Is easy to use. 
These kind of players don’t gamble with high bets and there for the wallet doesn’t need extra security and requires additional step before they can play a game. 
A wallet like MetaMask doesn’t have a recovery feature if you what to recover your public key. 
So I advise users to write down there mnemonic and store it in a safe place. 

For the high rollers I recommend two kinds of wallets: a play wallet and a non-play wallet.
the play wallet is the same as the wallet for normal players. 
And is use when the want to gamble and should only keep a small amount of the crypto’s the user owns. 

For the non-play wallet I recommend a Multisig wallet. 
This wallet will contain the majority of the crypto’s and therefor should have more security since losing access to this wallet is has a higher risk.
In addition if they want to transfer from the non-play to the play wallet they can choose a X out of Y confirmation before the currencies is transferred. 
When X is greater than 1 you need at least 2 confirmation to send the currencies and so the risk of accidental transfer is lowered. 
And this safer way to transfer but it’s not user friendly if you use this wallet for each time you want to spin the wheel.
